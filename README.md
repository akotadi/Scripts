### cpptest.bashrc

This script was made to quickly test my `.cpp` files. Typical uses are:
```bash
# Compile, execute and clean a cpp file:
testcpp <cpp_file>
```
If the `<cpp_file>` doesn't end in `.cpp`, the script won't run. Also, if the `<cpp_file>` doesn't exist, the script will exit.

The script also defines some flags:
* `-d`  to add the flag `-DDEBUG` at compilation time
* `-v <version_number>`  to add the flag `-std=c++<version_number>` at compilation time

This script can redirect the standard input and output at execution time like any command in Linux:
* `< <input_file>` 
* `> <output_file>` 

The script run these commands in order:
```bash
g++ <cpp_file> -o <cpp_file_name>.out -std=c++<version_number> -DDEBUG
```

```bash
./<cpp_file_name>.out
```

If any of them failed, will output the error and finish the execution.
